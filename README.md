#Instructions for Running Project Locally
##Backend:
```bash
The backend is a Maven SpringBoot application, and can be found at the following link https://github.com/birdpersson/isa.

It can be started normally as a Java project in Eclipse or IntelliJ (run SpringSecurityExampleApplication.java as Java Application).
Java 8 was used.
PostgreSQL is needed for the Backend.
Local database connection settings can be found in the application.properties file (src/main/resources/application.properties):
```

##Frontend:
```bash
The frontend is a Vue.js application, and can be found at the following link https://github.com/ljukip/isa-2021-isa-front-vue.

It can be started by running:
npm install and then
npm run serve in the containing folder.
Further installation details can be found at https://github.com/ljukip/isa-2021-isa-front-vue.

so that requests from the Frontend are directed to a Backend that is launched locally and not to one that was deployed on Heroku.
```
